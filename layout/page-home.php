<!-- Description --> 
<section class="l-light-gray l-pad-3">
    <div class="container">
        <p class="text-large text-center">
            I've been made by a developper not 100% satisfied with existing starter theme, like them, I'm not meant for being used as a parent theme, just adopt me and hack me !
            I'm very minimal & easy to understand, I use modern workflow like gulp, compass, susy and love.
            The website you are in is actualy me, so if you feel good here, I think you should give me a try !
