# MonsieurPress
Hello, I'm MonsieurPress, a super cool, lightweight & simple WordPress starter theme for developpers

## How am I ?
I've been made by a developper not 100% satisfied with underscore & bones starter theme, like them, I'm not meant for being used as a parent theme, just adopt me and hack me ! I'm very minimal & easy to understand, I use modern workflow like gulp, compass, susy and love. The website you are in is actualy me, so if you feel good here, I think you should give me a try !

## How to use me ?
Go to your wordpress theme folder with your terminal, and type the following commands : 

	$ git clone https://github.com/dadipaq/monsieurpress.git [yourthemename]
	$ npm install
	$ gulp
 
 You are now ready for happy coding !
